# Basic Racing Game

A simple Python game where you control a car and try to avoid obstacles. The game is built using the Pygame library, and your objective is to navigate your car and achieve the highest score without colliding with obstacles.

## Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (>=3.6)
- [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/)

   ```

3. Make sure you have the required dependencies installed:

## How to Play
1. Run the game by executing the following command:

2. Use the left and right arrow keys to move your car and avoid obstacles.

3. The game keeps track of your score, which increases as you progress.
